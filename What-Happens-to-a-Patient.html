        <h3>What Happens to a Patient when a Pharmaceutical Company Corrupts A Doctor?</h3>
        <h5>By Maradia Tsaava</h5>

            "Drink this medicine; my neighbor has been taking it for a long time and she told me it is fine.” Sopiko Veshapidze, an endocrinologist, has heard this phrase herself from one professional doctor at a polyclinic.
        </p> <p>
            Tata Prangishvili finished Tbilisi State Medical University and now works in the administration of St. John the Merciful Private Clinic. Last year a test discovered an endometriosis in her womb, and a  doctor advised her to take one drug which is manufactured in Ukraine and which would stop her natural cycle for six months. As she had a medical background, she refused to take these pills.
        </p>  <p>
            “I did not want to take hormonal medicine and artificially stop my cycle for 6 months, as this endometriosis is not a big danger or an alarming problem," she said. "A lot of women have this tiny mass, which does not progress and one can cure this in case of a wish for pregnancy. I could cure this whenever I decide to get pregnant. If I did not have medical background, I would not ask any questions and use this medicine, which is being produced only for a few years and whose side effects are not known yet.” Doctor also advised her for mini-surgery – laparoscopy -- but she rejected it also, as at that moment she thought it was unnecessary.
        </p>  <p>
            Veshapidze has been working in the polyclinics network for a long time and she knows the structure of how doctors cooperate with pharmacy companies.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Most doctors who work in polyclinics have low salaries," she said. "When pharmacy companies contact them and promote their medicine and offer them some financial benefits if prescribing this drug for patients, doctors don’t pay attention to the side effects of these drugs." She said most medicine has to be tested by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but some doctors don’t pay attention if this medicine has been accepted and controlled by the FDA or not.
        </p>  <p>
            Some pharmacy companies get the phone numbers of patients through the doctors and check whether patients are really taking their medicine or not. “Some medicine which is prescribed in excess might not cause harm, but some drugs are harmful if prescribed along with some other medicine. In this case also, doctors do not observe deeply while prescribing the medicine,” says Veshapidze.
        </p><p>
            According to George Zurabashvili, a cardiovascular surgeon, “besides financial problems, lack of education and professionalism is the reason for prescribing the wrong dosage of drugs. Some surgeons schedule overdose of antibiotics, and  antibiotics can extinguish all the bacterium in the organism. After this, organism gets used to high dose of antibiotics, and when antibiotics appear really necessary, they cannot react perfectly and the patient needs more and more doses."  of antibiotics.”  He also mentioned that there is a high expectation from patients to get a lot of medicine prescribed, and some might feel unsatisfied if the doctor doesn’t prescribed some, as if they think such doctors are not qualified enough.
        </p>  <p>
            So what is the solution? What to do when a person does not have a medical background or education? How can we avoid drug overdose, which may threaten our health? One way is for patients to research the information about each and every medicine they have to take on the Internet, where they can always find information about certain drugs. But, even in this case, one can face a problem: how to identify what information can be is trusted and what information is just sales promotion.
