        <h3>Treatment for Kidney Disease Is Lacking in Georgia</h3>
        <h5>By Mariam Abesadze</h5> 
        <p>
            When doctors diagnosed kidney failure for Tamar Getiashvili, she already had the third stage of inflammation of the kidney - nephritis -- and accordingly she was a candidate for dialysis. Getiashvili has been receiving peritoneal dialysis for five years, which is possible in the sterile conditions of her house. The procedure must be done every six hours in combination with a special diet.
        </p>   <p>
            But in the next stage of the disease, peritoneal dialysis is not enough for the patient and it is necessary to change to hemodialysis, which should be conducted for five hours every other day at a clinic.
        </p>    <p>
            Medical treatment for kidney failure is expensive. One dialysis session costs 40 Gel, plus the visit to the doctor, analysis of the blood, urinalysis and medicines. The government program “Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation” pays not only for the procedures, but also for the visit to the doctor, the analysis and the medicines. According to program coordinator Eka Adamia, the budget for the program is 320,000 Gel, of which 301,830 go for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, 15,470 Gel are for transplants and the immunosuppressive drugs that are necessary after the operation, and 2,700 Gel are for additional drugs and medical treatment.
        </p>    <p>
            All patients who have kidney failure and need dialysis can enter the government program after submitting a list of documents to the Social Service Agency. According to Adamia, more than 2,500 patients are already enrolled in the program.
        </p>   <p>
            The treatment for kidneys requires additional expenses for some patients. Getiashvili’s basic expenses are all paid, but she says she still needs additional drugs that are not sold in the drug stores of Georgia. One of the drugs is “Mimpara”, which is used for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with end-stage renal disease who are on maintenance dialysis therapy. It was prescribed by her doctor and if she does not get it, her muscles and joints hurt.
        </p> <p>
            The price is approximately 400 Gel and it lasts only one month. Because it is not available in Georgia, she bought it in Turkey, but she could only afford to buy it three times. There is also a medicine “Osvaren” that costs 100 Gel and the Municipal Government provides it to patients only once every three or four months. This medicine is for treatment of hyperphosphatemia associated with chronic renal insufficiency in patients undergoing dialysis.
        </p>  <p>
            According to the nephrologist at Tsulukidze National Center of Urology, Avtandil Tataradze, patients need only a small amount of “Mimpara”. That may explain why it is not imported into Georgia by pharmaceutical companies. Their business interests do not match the demands of the market."
        </p>     <p>
            “The pharmaceutical business is commercial and bringing in specific medicines is their prerogative,” declares Adamia, the government program coordinator.
        </p><p>
            .....There are other problems connected with dialysis. “Some of the patients acquire Hepatitis C because there are not sterile conditions in the clinics in Georgia that fully help patients with infectuous diseases,” said Getiashvili. According to the nephrologist Tataradze, the chances of catching Hepatitis C from the dialysis machine is almost impossible because they are programmed to be unusable before sterilization.  He says there have been a few cases because dialysis is a bloody process and there is some risk of mixing up the blood of patients. “I do not say that there are no guilty nurses or doctors, but it is very difficult to determine where a patient obtained this infection," Tataradze said. The program does not have statistical data on how many patients out of 2,500 caught Hepatitis C, and these patients are not getting treated in this program.
        </p>   <p>
            Kidney transplantation is a better solution for patients because then they will not need dialysis. The operation, which is conducted in Georgia, is funded by the governmenta program. But finding donors is a big problem. After finding them, analysis is sent abroad, which Tataradze says costs approximately 2,000-3,000 Gel, and is not funded by the government program. “But I have never had a  case when a patient could not have this operation because of money," he said. According to statistics, an average of 30 transplant operations are done annually in Georgia.
        </p>    <p>
            There is no system for deceased donor kidney transplant in Georgia that is well-organized and very effective like in European countries and USA, according to Tataradze. Adamia, the coordinator of the program “Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation”,  says there are no plans to create such a program in Georgia.
