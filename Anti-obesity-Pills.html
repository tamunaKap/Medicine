        <h3>Anti-obesity Pills Can Harm Health</h3>
        <h5> By Keti Mestvirishvili</h5>

            Obesity is the fastest growing public health problem. It’s something what many people suffer from. As doctors say, obesity is not a disease which can be cured in one week or one month. This is a chronic disease that needs permanent attention.
        </p> <p>
            According to the research “Anti-obesity Drugs: Past, Present and Future” made by R. John Rogers, Matthias T, Schop and John P.H. Wilding, it has been estimated that in 2005 some 400 million adults worldwide were obese, and 1.6 billion are overweight. People who suffer from obesity are recommended to visit a doctor, but in most cases they decide to cure themselves by strict diets, sometimes almost starving. Many of them decide to use anti-obesity pills without visiting a doctor. This decision can be even more harmful for health. That’s why it’s very important to take into consideration what doctors say.

            An endocrinologist at  “Aversi” clinic, Nino Gabidzashvili, discusses principles of losing weight on the webpage of “Aversi”. She says that according to research, it’s not recommended to use anti-obesity pills when a patient has the first stage of obesity. If a patient can reach the goal with body exercises, then there is no need to use drugs. Drugs are useful when diets and exercises are not working. Only some drugs have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certificates; they cause a lack of appetite and thus they work. “I wouldn’t advise anyone to use these drugs without visiting a doctor, because they may get a worse result. Sometimes these drugs cause more fatness,” says Gabidzashvili.

            There are some slimming products that have been banned by the FDA and World Health Organization (WHO). “Sibutramine” which appeared to cause non-fatal heart attacks or non-fatal strokes, was removed from the US market. Endocrinologist Lika Tsutskiridze explains that “Siburtamine” can’t be bought in Georgia pharmacies, but the problem is that these medicines can be bought online.

            In Georgia, pharmacies sell the anti-obesity drug “Orlip” which can be bought with a prescription. But in most cases, pharmacies offer consumers to get prescriptions by email or by their own doctor who gives prescriptions. But no one can check whether the patient really needs that prescription or not.

            “Anti-obesity pills include diuretics that cause thinness, but those pills are not recommended to use for a long time . Unless patients continue doing exercises, they will definitely gain weight again. FDA permits use of “Orlistat”, but if using only pills, patients  are unable to reach their goal,” says Tsutskiridze.  She says that sometimes patients think that they have to starve instead of being on a diet, but that diet means, to count calories and to plan how to feed oneself.

            Nutritionist Elene Shelestova believes that an anti-obesity pill that is fully reliable doesn't exist. “There are some drugs that help to lose appetite, but they are too expensive and many people cannot afford it. Some drugs that can be bought in Georgia, but I don’t trust them and don’t use them," says Shelestova. We asked her to list drugs that she prescribes, but she refrained from naming them.
        </p> <p>
            “It is very important that before any prescription, patients should research them,  and the anti-obesity pills should be prescribed by an endocrinologist," Shelestova said. "The most frequent problem is not to lose weight, but to maintain it."
