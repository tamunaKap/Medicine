        <h3> ZIs prescription system working in pharmacological sector?</h3>
        <h5>By Nino Abdaladze</h5>

        <p>
            More than a year has passed since the Georgian government established a prescription system for drugs following the practice of European countries. On September 1, 2014 the ministry established a prescription system under which many drugs can be sold only with a prescription.

            Minister of Health, Labor and Social Affairs David Sergeenko said the initiative will try to create better environment for the health care system and it has already brought important changes to the pharmacological field. While government officials announce positive outcomes, several researches and experts claim the opposite.

            According to ipress.ge the Deputy Health Minister Zaza Sofromadze stated that one of the major accomplishments is the 80 percent decline in so called “pharmaceutical drug addiction”. However, the survey conducted in 2015 by Curatio International Foundation and Public Union: Bemoni shows that there has been no significant change in the usage of non injection drugs since 2012. The mostly used non injection drugs were Hallucinogens and CNS depressants.

            According to 2015 Transparency International Georgia research: “Public Opinion on Medication Use and the Prescription System" one in every 10 respondents has bought prescription drugs without a prescription. According to the organization’s senior analyst in health, finance and economic issues, Mikheil Kukava, they expected that number would be much higher. Kukava says the problem truly exists and it needs to be solved. “We offered the Georgian government the online system of prescription, as well as making a patient online card.”-says Kukava, who says this change would increase the transparency of the system.

            According to research in the scientific journal “Health Policy and Insurance” N2. (2015) “The prescription system in Georgia”  has shown drugs are still sold without showing the ingredients, especially the ones that can cause serious damage to one’s health if used improperly or without the doctor’s prescription. The research concludes that the problem can be solved by establishing an online prescription system.

            Khatuna Gigauri, 48, bought Metfogamma in one of Pharmadepot’s pharmacies several months ago. Even though now the pharmacy sells this drug with a prescription, you can get it through a telephone consultation. Metfogamma is used to treat diabetes, together with special diet. As written in the note that comes with the drug, if not used properly, it can have serious side effects such as problems while driving a car. Gigauri says Pharmadepot was the only pharmaceutical network which sold this drug without prescription.

            Ana, 22, (who asked that her last name not be used) has bought Nimesil at a non-network pharmacy located in Tbilisi. Nimesil is a painkiller commonly used in Georgia, but it is prohibited in many countries such as the USA and Canada because of its side effects, including liver failure. According to the Transparency International research, the number of Nimesil pills imported in Georgia in 2014 was 1,066,393. After establishing the prescription system, usage of this drug decreased. From January through May 2015, the number of Nimesil pills imported was 53,798.

            The prescription system is regulated by State Regulation Agency for Medical Activities and the Ministry in accordance with the Georgian law on Medicine and Pharmacological Activity. Ministry senior specialist Tamar Manjavidze says the prescription system is successful for two main reasons: it reduces the amount of money that people spend on drugs as they only buy the ones they truly need. According to the Health Care System Performance Assessment Report published in 2013 by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Affairs, high expenses on medicine were caused by irrational pharmacotherapy, the lack of prescription system and the acts of self treatment. As Manjavidze says, the prescription system decreases self-treatment that can seriously harm one's health condition. “People used to buy antibiotics every time they sneezed, and such high usage can reduce resistance. The prescription system successfully deals with this problem,” says Manjavidze. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) survey conducted in Georgia, the percentage of self-treatment was reduced to 6.2 percent in 2014 from 8.7 percent in 2010. Manjavidze says every violation of the prescription system should be punished in accordance with the level of the violation. She also sees a solution in creating an online prescription system.

            The ministry plans to establish the online prescription system starting in 2016. Some clinics have already joined the program. An online prescription system can better show the overall circulation of a medicine. Patients will save time and money as they won’t have to wait for hours at a doctor’s office. However, it can cause problems for people who live in the regions and don’t have access to the internet. Ministry department head Marina Darakhvelidze stated on the Public Broadcaster that the process will develop step-by-step and such problems will be considered in advance.
        </p> <p>
            Even though the prescription system has brought serious changes in the pharmacological sector, it still needs to be more transparent and better regulated. Nowadays the system is not easily monitored as the prescription transforms from doctor to patient to the pharmacy and is not kept in an online system. Authorities find it difficult to detect every violation of the regulations. Healthcare professionals say the situation would be improved with the the help of an online prescription system.
