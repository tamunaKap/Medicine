    <h3>  Instalment payments are introduced  to buy medicines</h3>
    <h5> By Zurab Mamagulashvili</h5>

   <p>On November 16, 2015, GPC Pharmacy launched a new campaign. Medicines that cost more than 100 lari can be purchased via installment payments. One can make an agreement with either TBC or Liberty Bank and pay over 3-6 months. GPC Pharmacy public relations manager Tea Javakhishvili says the response so far has been positive. .
    The Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia is addressing the affordability of medicines. The ministry says it can't control private industry because of free market principles in Georgia, but that it was not wise to launch the payment installments while the government is trying to make it easier for people to buy medicines with the help of new programs.
    Last year's devaluation of the lari affects the prices of medicines. According to statistics, the price of hundreds of medicines increased, which is especially difficult for pensioners. GPC manager Tea Javakhishvili says that one of the main advantages of their campaign is that customers don’t have to contact the bank and GPC itself pays the service expenses. But if someone dissolves an installment agreement, they will have to settle the problem with the bank, It also depends on the credit history of the customer. If it is not positive, the bank has the right to decide whether a customer qualifies. Customers can also be excluded from getting extra services and bonuses from the pharmacy company.
    Several years ago Liberty Bank launched a campaign for pensioners, who could take loans, and if they paid them back within a month, the bank could deduct money from their monthly pension to pay those loans. The campaign seemed to hurt pensioners, and then-President Mikheil Saakashvili criticized Liberty Bank. Some experts see similarities between these two campaigns and predict the same results.
    Marina Batiashvili, a 66-year-old pensioner, learned about the program a month ago. She decided to try it because she couldn’t afford all her medicines. " I have cardiovascular malformation," she said. "To treat it, I need really expensive medicines. It’s easier to pay monthly for now as I have a pension, but I don’t know what will happen in the future.”
    A GPC marketing specialist Kote Gelashvili said the company would not provide information on the number of people who use the service because its sales information is confidential. A Georgian Young Lawyers' Association (GYLA) said GPC is a private company and has the right not to provide information about sales and finances.
    “This is the service for people who need special expensive medicines and have no money the moment they need it,." Said Kote Gelashvili "The project was tested and we didn’t start it until we knew it would work properly.”
    Kote Gelashvili, GPC marketing specialist said that the company pays bank charges and the customer is free of extra fees. For example, if the consumer buys 300 lari of products and makes 6 monthly installment payments of 50 lari, there is no other charges. But if the payments are not made, the consumer automatically is referred to the bank and for the first late day pays a 20 lari fine. The fine increases each day 2% of the total sum.
    “For me as a doctor, it is good when a patient has the opportunity to buy quality products, even via payment installment payments," said Doctor, surgeon Oleg Kvitsiani. “There are Georgian pharmacy companies medicines that cost, for example, 1.5 lari, but they are useless.
    </p>
    <p> In reality, they have no effect. It is better to buy good quality products that cost 19 lari. Of course, launching this new program shows that the country’s social and economic condition is worsening.” Oleg Kvitsiani
    Pharmacy agency former head Tina Turdziladze says it’s hard for citizens today to buy medicines with cash. Pharmacy company sales went down, so now they’re trying to increase sales. She says this project is an example, but the problems can be bigger than the profits because some people may not use it rationally.
    Now a new pharmacy company “Humanity Georgia” is entering the Georgian market promising lower prices, but there are questions about their plans.
