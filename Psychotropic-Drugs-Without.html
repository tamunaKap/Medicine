        <h3> Psychotropic Drugs Without Prescriptions are Still on Sale</h3>
        <h5>By Thea Ghvinadze</h5> 
        <p>
            A total of 114 administrative offence reports were filed and 12 pharmacies have been forced to stop operating in Georgia in 2015 because of the illegal distribution of pharmaceutical products. Monitored by the State Regulation Agency for Medical Activities, the medicines include narcotics, psychotropic medicines and medicines containing specially controlled psychoactive substances.
        </p>  <p>
            The offenses are violations of the Georgian Law of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Activities Chapter 6, which prohibits selling psychotropic products without prescription.
        </p>  <p>
            The law of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Activities was adopted in July 2013 and has been amended. Selling psychotropic medicines without a doctor’s consultation was already illegal, but the new regulation created a special control group and specifically identified the list of medicines which should be prohibited without prescription. In January 2014, the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs reclassified some products (Baklofen, Gabapentin, Zopiclone, Zaleplon and Tropicamide) to the special control group. The alarming level of consuming them like narcotics by Georgian youth was named as the main reason for the changes.
        </p> <p>
            Non-therapeutic consumption of psychotropic medicines is very dangerous for health. According to narcotics expert Nikoloz Kapanadze: “it can cause loss of memory and concentration, radical changes of personality, severe physical problems, psychosis, anxieties, warped ideas, delusion, epilepsy symptoms and other side effects.” At the same time, psychotropic medicines are psychologically and physically addictive and to stop using them can be very painful.
        </p> <p>
            “An effective way to stop non-therapeutic use of psychotropic medicines is complex treatment in specialized institutions, which should definitely include intensive psychotherapy as well,” Kapanadze says. "I’ve heard several times that despite the fact that selling psychotropic medicines without prescription is prohibited, some pharmacies still continue illegal trade."

        </p>  <p>
            I decided to make an experiment and find out whether it was true or not.
        </p> <p>
            And it was true. In December 2015 I asked one of my friends to take part in my experiment and try to buy a psychotropic medicine without prescription. My friend agreed. He went  to Tbilisi center, entered a pharmacy and bought Gabapentin (600mg) for 6 GEL without any problems. Gabapentin is one of those pharmaceutical products in the group consider to have a very high level of non-therapeutic use and risk to citizens. The pharmacist did not ask my friend for a prescription or any other documents; she just sold the medicine as if it was legal to do so.
        </p>   <p>
            This experiment indicated that today psychotropic drugs are still very cheap and easy to access illegally. Despite the regulations, consumers can still know exact pharmacies where they can be bought without prescriptions. According to Kapanadze, there are no official statistics available but, informal data indicates that a majority of youth (including those under 18) have tried a psychotropic product for a non-therapeutic reason at least once in his/her life.
        </p>  <p>
            > The distribution of psychotropic medicines in Georgia is controlled by the State Regulation Agency for Medical Activities. Each pharmacy is checked at least once a year. Psychotropic drugs are accounted for carefully, so illegal actions can hardly be hidden. During the inspection process, the pharmacy should present the prescriptions, warrants or agreements. Without their existence, the inspection group concludes that these drugs have been sold without prescriptions. When this violation occurs, the pharmacy is put under intensified inspection, which includes more frequent checking.
        </p><p>
            Under the Georgian Law for Medicine and Pharmaceutical Activities, the amount of penalty for the first violation is 6000 GEL. In case of second violations,  the penalty is doubled. The third violation penalizes the pharmacy 12,000GEL again, and if the violation happens for the fourth time in one calendar year, the pharmacy is ordered to stop operating. As mentioned above, 114 administrative offence reports were filed and 12 pharmacies were ordered to stop operating in 2015. There were 250 administrative offence reports and 11 pharmacies ordered to stop operating in 2014.
        </p>  <p>
            According to Nana Shashiashvili, the head of inspection administration at the Department of Pharmaceutical Activities in the State Regulation Agency for Medical Activities, violations happen quite often, but not because of weak inspections.
        </p> <p>
            “Despite the fact that we cancel the permission for pharmaceutical activity, the offender just registers another limited company, changes the director, requests the license at the same administrative address, and continues unlawful action. Behind the new limited company there is still the same offender. And we don’t have any regulation in order to deny giving the license to him again. We face these kind of experiences very often in our practice,” Shashiashvili says. She added that the Regulation Agency has penalized the same owners under different company names  several times.
        </p>   <p>
            “Specific changes should be made in the procedure for giving licenses in order to make the re-opening process stricter for offenders. The inspection process has no defects,” she says.
        </p><p>
            Shashiashvili states that any regulation which can’t ensure the prevention of a considerable number of violations needs to be reviewed. The State Regulation Agency for Medical Activities has prepared some legislative initiatives in order to decrease violations.
        </p> <p>
            The first initiative states that the director or the responsible person of the pharmacy should be prosecuted. Another initiative advises limiting the number of the pharmacies, based on  geographic and demographic principles. Under a proposed regulation, a person will not be allowed to open a pharmacy on the same site as one that has already been ordered to stop operating due to violations. This will apply only to authorized pharmacies which satisfy specific requirements in order to be allowed to distribute psychotropic medicines.
        </p><p>
            The State Regulation Agency for Medical Activities is now waiting for decisions from several governmental institutions in order to apply to the Parliament as soon as possible.
        </p>   <p>
            Any citizen who discovers any kind of violation can call the hotline of Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs (1505) and give the information to them.
