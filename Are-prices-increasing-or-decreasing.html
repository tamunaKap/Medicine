        <h3>Are prices increasing or decreasing?</h3>
        <h5> By Tatuli Omiadze</h5>

            Georgian pharmaceutical market is becoming even more expensive. From 2014 to 2015 the prices have risen 17.7%. These include antibiotics, vitamins, painkillers, blood thinners, anti-inflammatory drugs and digestive system drugs.
        </p>  <p>
            The increases are caused by currency depreciation, although prices also increased 14.2% between 2013 and 2014 before the depreciation. The high cost of drugs is a heavy burden on the pockets of the population.
        </p>   <p>
            The liberalization of the regulatory framework by the Georgian government created the environment in which pharmaceutical companies can mark up prices based on market supply levels and profit margins.
        </p><p>
            In October of 2015, the Minister of Health and Social Affairs Davit Sergenko said that at the end of 2015 the prices for 200 of the most used drugs would be reduced.
        </p> <p>
            Health expert Vaxtang Megrelishvili on the radio show “Hearing Each Other” commented that in Georgian society there are two groups: one for whom drug prices are unacceptable and can’t buy them, and one for whom it doesn’t matter.  He said the minister's announcement about lowering some prices is only a pre-election promise, since the government created the system in which drug prices can't be regulated.
        </p> <p>
            Health care specialist Akaki Zoidze notes that most medications are imported. He says the solution is subsidization.
        </p><p>
            “Price declines should come from competition, and the State has to intervene in it, too” says Zoidze. He points out that Georgians take more medicine each month that people in many other countries.

            Customers say prices are high and it’s very big problem, especially for pensioners and vulnerable people. “I have some disease. The doctor writes a lot of prescriptions for me. It takes a long time to complete treatment. I can’t buy almost half of them , because the drug prices are too high,” said customer Sopo Buava.
        </p>  <p>
            “My daughter is 23. She has big digestive system problems. Every day she is taking nine different pills. Every time I go to the pharmacy the pills are more expensive. I don't have a low income, but this is really too much for all buyers. I don’t remember so high prices on medicine in my lifetime,” said customer Nana Beltadze.
        </p> <p>
            “We do not want drug prices to rise, but at the same time it is hard to maintain the company in such conditions. The company can hardly exist without any profit,” said Paata Kurtanidze, founder  of pharmaceutical company “Aversi”.
        </p>  <p>
            Tina Turdziladze of the Health Experts Club says: “Drug prices include expenses for research, and that pricing analysis has not been done. But the way it is now has a negative impact not only on the buyer (population), but also on the seller (pharmaceutical companies) and the products  (quality of drug).”
        </p> <p>
            The Association of Young Financiers and Businessmen (AYFB)  introduced a new Panaskerteli Index (named for a 15th century Georgia medical pioneer) to  monitor medicine prices for three months (November 2015 to January 2016). AYFB says it monitored prices for 200 of the most use medicines  which were selected on the basis of negotiations and consultations with the national drug agency and independent experts.
        </p> <p>
            In December  the Panaskerteli Index decreased by 1.75% and in the January the Index declined by 4.64%,  which the authors say proves  that prices are going down. .
        </p>  <p>
            Official data doesn’t support the AYFB  findings:  According to  January-February  National Statistics office of Georgia data, prices for health products, equipment and ambulatory care have increased by 11 percent.   AYFB   director Shota Gulbani  says comparing these two data  sets is not useful as the methodologies and monitored medicines  differ.  Gulbani says he is going to provide more detailed information in the future to answer the questions  raised by his  study findings.

            The recent major development in the  pharmaceutical market is the arrival of the new company Humanity Georgia, ( LINK)  which has ambitious plans. Their arrival is positively assessed by specialists, doctors and politicians alike, who agree that it will increase competition in the country’s pharmaceutical market and increase access to medicines.
