        <h3>Autism program progress and limits</h3>
        <h5>By Jamila Ibrahimova</h5>
        <p>
            Autism is a neuro-developmental disorder that is noticed during social interaction, communication, and sometimes in behavior that seems slow.  Globally, autism is calculated to have an effect on 21.7 million people as of 2013. It is 4 to 5 times more common in boys than girls. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly attributable to changes in diagnostic observation and government-subsidized diagnosis programs.
        </p>  <p>
            A new program of government-funded care was launched in Georgia in July, 2015. So far it reaches only children in the capital of Tbilisi, which is only a fraction of the estimated 7,000 children with autism in the country. In some areas there is no help.
        </p> <p>
            Sophiko Kereselidze, Head of the Autism Center in Georgia, underlines the importance of the program: ‘’There was no program or even any center supporting autistic children," she said. "In 2010, we signed a memorandum with Ilia State University and launched the first Autism Center in Georgia, which is a training and education institution designed for children on the autistic spectrum. I believe the program will help lots of children. We are happy of that our efforts started this program.’’

            “One in 88 kids in the world is born with autism syndrome. In Georgia, no comprehensive studies are conducted; however, there are pilot studies that indicate the figures are similar. If medical care is started early enough, 50 percent of children will live absolutely normal lives,” Kereselidze says. “With the help of this program, it is possible to identify and study children with autism. It is also important to enxpand the program to the whole country, because there are lots of children who need the help.”

            Nino Kitia, mother of Nikolas Kitia (10), a boy with autism syndrome, supports the program with great enthusiasm.

            “Now we are taking part in the program and it is great that we have such a chance. Of course, I would prefer that the program offered more activities, but since it’s a new program I believe children with autism will have a better future," Nino Kitia said. ‘’We diagnosed autism in Nikolas when he was 3 years old. We attended the Autism Center at Ilia State University from the first years of its activity and it helped us a lot. I hope all children in Georgia will be able to use this program.’’
        </p>   <p>
            Experts in the field highlight the importance of raising public awareness so as to facilitate early identification and so society understands autism better. World Syndrome Awareness Day on April 12 has been held in Georgia for the last four years. This year, a special event for kids washed at the Tbilisi zoo.
